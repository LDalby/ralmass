# ralmass

This is currently just a selection of R functions that are used to prepare GIS data for use in the individual based model system [ALMaSS](http://almass.dk).
The few functions in the package at the moment are all used for data preparation, but in due course functions to handle output from ALMaSS will be added.

ALMaSS it self is hosted on ccpforge. See more on the [ALMaSS project page](http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/almass/).
