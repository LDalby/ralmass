\title{Calculate the fit of the simulated flock size distribution to the observed
flock size distribution}
\usage{
CalcFlockSizeFit(Sim = NULL, Obs = NULL, species = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Sim}{data.table A data.table with a columns identifying the species 
and a column with each flock observation from the simulation.}

\item{Obs}{data.table Same as Sim but field observations.}

\item{species}{character Either Barnacle, Pinkfoot or Greylag.}

\item{measure}{character Either LS or SSSE}
}
\value{
numeric The calculated fit.
}
\description{
Calculate fit between the simulated flock size distribution to the observed
flock size distribution based on the sum of standardized squared 
errors (SSSE, Frank & Baret 2013) or 1 minus the least squares difference.
}
\details{
The fit is measured on the proportions of the flock sizes falling into
each bin of 10% quantiles of the observed range of flock sizes. 
The fit is in both cases measured over the entire season.
