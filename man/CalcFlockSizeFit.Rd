\title{Calculate the fit of the simulated flock size distribution to the observed
flock size distribution}
\usage{
CalcFlockSizeFit(Sim = NULL, Obs = NULL, species = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Sim}{data.table A data.table with a columns identifying the species 
and a column with each flock observation from the simulation.}

\item{species}{character Either Barnacle, Pinkfoot or Greylag.}

\item{Field}{data.table Same as Sim but field observations.}
}
\description{
Calculate fit between the simulated flock size distribution to the observed
flock size distribution based on the sum of standardized squared 
errors (SSSE, Frank & Baret 2013). The SSSE is here based on the proportions
of the flock sizes falling into each bin of roughly 1/10 of the observed
range of flock sizes. The upper bins were truncated to avoid empty bins.
The fit is measured over the entire season.
