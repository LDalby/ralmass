\title{Calculate the fit of the simulated forage distance distribution to the
 observed forage distance distribution}
\usage{
CalcForageDistFit(Sim = NULL, Obs = NULL, species = NULL,
  measure = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Sim}{data.table A data.table distances calculated by CalcDistToRoosts}

\item{Obs}{data.table Same as Sim but field observations.}

\item{species}{character Either Barnacle, Pinkfoot or Greylag.}

\item{measure}{character Either LS or SSSE}
}
\value{
numeric The calculated fit.
}
\description{
Calculate fit between the simulated forage distance distribution to the observed
forage distance distribution based on the sum of standardized squared 
errors (SSSE, Frank & Baret 2013) or 1 minus the least squares difference.
}
\details{
The fit is based on the proportions of the forage distances falling
into each bin of 10% quantiles of the observed range of forage distances.
 The fit is measured over the entire season.
