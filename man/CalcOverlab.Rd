\title{Calculate the overlap of kernel densities}
\usage{
CalcOverlab(data, species = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.table An object containing both the simulated and observed 
flock sizes}

\item{species}{character The species for which the calculated for.
Either 'Barnacle', 'Pinkfoot','Greylag' or 'Hunter'}
}
\value{
numeric The overlap
}
\description{
Calculate the overlap of kernel densities. Either densities of flock sizes
calculated from field observations and from the simulated flock sizes, of 
hunter densities on farms or kernel densities of number of hunters per farm
}
