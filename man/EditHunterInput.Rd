\description{
Some of the input parameters for the hunter model are given as individual
values to each object. This is controlled via the
 Hunter_Hunting_Locations.txt file and \code{EditHunterInput} will
apply changes to specified inputs.
}
\details{
\code{change} gives the proportion of hunters which will have a 1 in 
WeekdayHunterChance or GooseLookChance. When \code{parameter} is HuntingDays
\code{change} will increase (when \code{change} > 1) or decrease 
(when \code{change} < 1) the already existing distribution of HuntingDays. 
When \code{parameter} is Efficiency, \code{change} will be the actual value
given to all hunters.

\code{weekbehav} controls the weekly hunting behaviour. 0 is weekend hunting
only (default), 1 is not weekend only and 2 means leave a refraction period
 in between hunting events. The refraction period is controlled by a config
 variable in ALMaSS.
