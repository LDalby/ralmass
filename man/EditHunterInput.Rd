\item{hhlpath}{character Path to an existing Hunter_Hunting_Locations.txt file}

\item{parameter}{character Name of parameter to apply change to}

\item{change}{numeric The change to apply. See details}

hunters be modified? See details}
}
\value{
A tab separated text file formatted as an ALMaSS input file.
}
\description{
Some of the input parameters for the hunter model are given as individual
values to each object. This is controlled via the
 Hunter_Hunting_Locations.txt file and \code{EditHunterInput} will
apply changes to specified inputs.
}
\details{
\code{change} gives the proportion of hunters which will have a 1 in 
WeekdayHunterChance or GooseLookChance. When \code{parameter} is HuntingDays
\code{change} will increase (when \code{change} > 1) or decrease 
(when \code{change} < 1) the already existing distribution of HuntingDays. 
When \code{parameter} is Efficiency, \code{change} will be the actual value
given to all hunters.

\code{weekbehav} controls the weekly hunting behaviour. 0 is weekend hunting
only (default), 1 is not weekend only and 2 means leave a refraction period
 in between hunting events. The refraction period is controlled by a config
 variable in ALMaSS.

\code{file} is the orginal Hunter_Hunting_Locations.txt file to modify and 
\code{hhlpath} gives the path to where the modified 
Hunter_Hunting_Locations.txt is written to.

\code{huntersubset} Defines the subset of hunters to apply change to. 
By default we only modify WeekdayHunterChance and GooseLookChance for
the 343 expert goose hunters. If the change should be applied across
all hunters, set \code{huntersubset = 'all'}. The 403 occasional hunters
can be modified by using \code{huntersubset = 'occasional'} and the expert
group by \code{huntersubset = 'experts'}
