\usage{
PlotProbe0(data, seasons = FALSE, lty = "l", add = FALSE,
  species = "Dormouse", package = "ggplot2")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.table The raw output from probe0 or probe from ALMaSS}

\item{seasons}{logical Should breeding season and hibernation polygons be added to the plot?
(dormouse specific)}

\item{lty}{character Either 'l' = lines, 'b' both lines and point.}

\item{add}{Should the plot be added to an already existing plot in the plot window?}

\item{species}{What species is the plot for? (currenly only "Dormouse", "Goose", "Hare" available)}

\item{package}{What package to use for plotting? Either 'base' or 'ggplot2'}
}
\value{
A nice plot

\description{
Plot the results from probe0
}
\details{
If the species you simulated does not use all 6 columns in the probe0.res
file, you should get rid of the redundant columns before calling this
function.

Note: you should read the results file using the fread function in the data.table package
It is very fast - you will not regret it.
